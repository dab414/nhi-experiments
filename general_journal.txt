	trying to get a handle on the thickness of lines and what distribution spread would be appropriate
	the perceived difference in thickness between 1 px vs. >= 1.15 px is obvious
		that same perception between anything even 0.5 px apart is really challenging when they're presented right next to each other

		suggests the function between perceived and actual thickness is not linear

	we discovered that width is perceived different depending on angle of line rotation
		unclear whether the difference is perceptual, mechanical or both
