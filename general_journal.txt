	alright can i organize this mess at all?
	what would a publishable finding from these data even look like?
		think: problem -> cause -> solution
	problems are the biases that have been outlined
		i could still look at the extent to which these search biases impact performance
		could correlate IDs in search biases with IDs in accuracy
	also correlate IDs in response time (& clustering groups) with choice biases

	i think these correlations are worth doing and might be informative.. but we have such weak causal leverage in this paradigm
		addressing the 'cause' part of my chain above is going to be tentative at best

	trying to get a handle on the thickness of lines and what distribution spread would be appropriate
	the perceived difference in thickness between 1 px vs. >= 1.15 px is obvious
		that same perception between anything even 0.5 px apart is really challenging when they're presented right next to each other

		suggests the function between perceived and actual thickness is not linear

	we discovered that width is perceived different depending on angle of line rotation
		unclear whether the difference is perceptual, mechanical or both
