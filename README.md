*7/9/2021*  
Most recent updates to "compare lines" pilot:  

* Finished the line drawing code so that changing global params should update everything automatically  
* Added an Excel sheet with conditions to control line orientation and timing  

Still to do:  

* Response collection  
* Hammer out exact procedure details  
	* eg, how much time should first line be visible before it disappears, same for line two
* Implement line width manipulation  
* Look into drawing via vectors instead of pixels
